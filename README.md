<!-- Plugin description -->
The Coder Gateway plugin lets you open [Coder](https://github.com/coder/coder)
workspaces in your JetBrains IDEs with a single click.

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend using the [Coder Toolbox plugin](https://github.com/coder/coder-jetbrains-toolbox), which offers significant stability and connectivity benefits over Gateway. Future updates of the Coder plugin on Jetbrains will be made to the Toolbox plugin. Reference our [documentation](https://coder.com/docs/user-guides/workspace-access/jetbrains/toolbox) for more information.


**Manage less**

- Ensure your entire team is using the same tools and resources
  - Rollout critical updates to your developers with one command
- Automatically shut down expensive cloud resources
- Keep your source code and data behind your firewall

**Code more**

- Build and test faster
  - Leveraging cloud CPUs, RAM, network speeds, etc.
- Access your environment from any place on any client (even an iPad)
- Onboard instantly then stay up to date continuously
