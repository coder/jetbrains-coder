<!-- Plugin description -->
The Coder Toolbox Gateway plugin lets you open [Coder](https://github.com/coder/coder)
workspaces from Toolbox with a single click.

**Manage less**

  - Rollout critical updates to your developers with one command
- Automatically shut down expensive cloud resources
- Keep your source code and data behind your firewall

**Code more**

- Build and test faster
  - Leveraging cloud CPUs, RAM, network speeds, etc.
- Access your environment from any place on any client (even an iPad)
- Onboard instantly then stay up to date continuously
